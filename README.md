# Flammable_gas_detector

Welcome on my <b>flammable gas detector</b> project. In this repository, you'll find everything to do a detection of flammable gas leak at home or wherever you need. 

<h1>Details about the project</h1>
For details about this project, please refer to the document named "Paul_VANDEWIELE_Specifications.pdf"
This file is a description of the project, with the context, functionnal analysis, standards and prototype. 

<h2>Hardware</h2>
If you want to do this project at home, you'll have to :
1) own a TAB5 from M5 STACK
2) own a ESP32 (a WROOM32 has been used for this project)
3) own a UNIT MQ (sensor for flammable gas detection)

<h2>Software</h2>
<h3>files</h3>
Take the file "receiver_V3.ino" and compile it on your TAB5
Take the file "sender_V3.ino" and compile it on you ESP. 

<h3>troobleshooting</h3>
There is a possibility that the file "sender_V3.ino" do not compile on your ESP. 
If so, please unplug the sensor and once compiled, re-plug it !

<h2>video</h2>
Finally, you can watch my short video to have an overview of the prototype. 

<h1>HAPPY DETECTION ;)</h1>
Hope you'll enjoy it !
